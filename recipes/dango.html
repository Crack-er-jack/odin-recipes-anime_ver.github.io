        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Dango is a chewy and sweet rice flour ball candy. Dango are often served on skewers, and one of the most popular types of dango is hanami dango, which is a skewer consisting of pink, white, and green dango enjoyed during cherry blossom viewings in Japan.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Glutinous rice flour or Mochiko</li>
            <li>Fresh silken tofu</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>Matcha powder for green dango</li>
            <li>Strawberry powder for pink dango</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The first step is to make the dough by combining the tofu, flour and sugar in a large bowl. Use your hands to squeeze the mixture together, almost in a kneading motion until everything is well incorporated. Then divide the dough into 3 equal portions.</li>
            <li>Add the matcha powder into one portion of dough and mix until the colour is uniform. Add the strawberry powder or pink food colouring into another portion of dough and mix until the colour is uniform.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 5-6 equal sized pieces. For 5 pieces, each piece should weigh 14-15 grams. If 6 pieces, 11-12 grams each.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a ball using your palms.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the dango balls in. Let them cook until they start floating to the top. Then use a strainer ladle to scoop them out.</li>
            <li>Place the dango into a bowl of ice water to stop them from cooking.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, place the dango balls in a bamboo skewer in this order: green, white pink. Repeat for the remaining balls. Oishi!</li>
